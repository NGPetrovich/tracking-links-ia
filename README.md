# Tracking Links cleaning process automation

## Here is what you need to do to install it and test that it works:

1. Download/clone/pull the repository to your local machine
2. First, test that the code is working: in the root directory, open the terminal and write: `python affiliate-automation.py`
3. That's it! You should wait until script ends and your **final.csv** file will be available in the root directory.

## If you want to make this script working for you perform the following steps:

1. Enter "extract-here" folder and remove the test data file.
2. Add the actual file from Income Access.
3. Open the terminal and write: `python affiliate-automation.py`
4. That's it! You should wait until script ends and your **final.csv** file will be available in the root directory.
